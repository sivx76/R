########## Activities 1-3 #############

# Write a script (NOT A FUNCTION!) that simulates throwing balls into urns (Activity 1),
# creates a histogram of the number of balls in each urn (Activity 2),
# and prints the index of dispersion to the console (Activity 3).

# If you don't like balls and urns, you can call your variables nBees and nFlowers, 
# nVirions and nCells, or whatever you want.
