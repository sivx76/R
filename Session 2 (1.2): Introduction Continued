# Week 1 Friday Homework

######## Question 1 starts here ######
#Find out whether a number is divisible by 3
print("Question 1")

# Write your program for Question 1 here.
#1) Program to determine whether a number is divisible by 3. Then print the value of this variable.

num_1to10 = 1:10 #I am using this to test.
print('Here are the #s we are considering: 1 to 10.')
print(num_1to10)

print('We will print out the numbers that are divisible by 3.')
for (n in num_1to10)
  {if (n %%3 ==0)
    {print(n)}
  }


######## Question 2 starts here ######
#Find out whether a number divides another number evenly. Print this out.
print('------')
print("Question 2")

new_num_set = 1:31
print('For this example, we are testing the numbers 1 to 31.')

for (n in new_num_set)
  {if (n %%2 == 0)
    {print(n)}

  }



####### Question 3 starts here ######
#Store all even numbers from 1 to 100 in a vector and print them
print("Question 3")

vector100 = 1:100
print(vector100)

evenlist = 0 #this or c(0) did also work

for (n in vector100)
{
  if (n %%2 == 0)
  {
    evenlist = c(evenlist, n) #this did not work: n + evenlist (produced one sum)
  }
}

print(evenlist)


###### Question 4 starts here
#Determine whether a number is prime
print("Question 4")

#Note: a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 
#that is has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

test_prime = 9 
result = TRUE

lower_bound = 2
upper_bound = test_prime - 1
numbers_to_check = c(lower_bound:upper_bound)
print(numbers_to_check)

for (number in numbers_to_check)
{
  if (test_prime %% number == 0) 
  {result = FALSE}
  
  print(result)
}


###### Question 5 starts here
#Store all prime numbers from 1 to 200 in a vector and print them
print("Question 5")

test_prime = 1:200 
result = 'NOT PRIME' #wizardry here is needed

lower_bound = 2
upper_bound = length(test_prime) - 1
numbers_to_check = c(lower_bound:upper_bound)
print(numbers_to_check)

for (number in numbers_to_check) #issue here too, perhaps
{
  if (test_prime %% number == 0) 
  {result = 'PRIME'}
  
  print(result)
}
