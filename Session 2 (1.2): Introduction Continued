# Week 1 Friday Homework

######## Question 1 starts here ######
#Find out whether a number is divisible by 3
print("Question 1")

# Write your program for Question 1 here.
#1) Program to determine whether a number is divisible by 3. Then print the value of this variable.

num_1to10 = 1:10 #I am using this to test.
print('Here are the #s we are considering: 1 to 10.')
print(num_1to10)

print('We will print out the numbers that are divisible by 3.')
for (n in num_1to10)
  {if (n %%3 ==0)
    {print(n)}
  }


######## Question 2 starts here ######
#Find out whether a number divides another number evenly. Print this out.
print('------')
print("Question 2")

new_num_set = 1:31
print('For this example, we are testing the numbers 1 to 31.')

for (n in new_num_set)
  {if (n %%2 == 0)
    {print(n)}

  }



####### Question 3 starts here ######
#Store all even numbers from 1 to 100 in a vector and print them
print("Question 3")

vector100 = 1:100
print(vector100)

evenlist = 0 #this or c(0) did work

for (n in vector100)
{
  if (n %%2 == 0)
  {
    evenlist = c(evenlist, n) #this did not work: n + evenlist
  }
}

print(evenlist)


###### Question 4 starts here
#Determine whether a number is prime
print("Question 4")





###### Question 5 starts here
#Store all prime numbers from 1 to 200 in a vector and print them
print("Question 5")
