# Week 1 Friday Homework

######## Question 1 starts here ######
#Find out whether a number is divisible by 3
print("Question 1")

# Write your program for Question 1 here.
#1) Program to determine whether a number is divisible by 3. Then print the value of this variable.

num_1to10 = 1:10 #I am using this to test.
print('Here are the #s we are considering: 1 to 10.')
print(num_1to10)

print('We will print out the numbers that are divisible by 3.')
for (n in num_1to10)
  {if (n %%3 ==0)
    {print(n)}
  }


######## Question 2 starts here ######
#Find out whether a number divides another number evenly. Print this out.
print('------')
print("Question 2")

new_num_set = 1:31
print('For this example, we are testing the numbers 1 to 31.')

for (n in new_num_set)
  {if (n %%2 == 0)
    {print(n)}

  }



####### Question 3 starts here ######
#Store all even numbers from 1 to 100 in a vector and print them
print("Question 3")

vector100 = 1:100
print(vector100)

evenlist = 0 #this or c(0) did work

for (n in vector100)
{
  if (n %%2 == 0)
  {
    evenlist = c(evenlist, n) #this did not work: n + evenlist (produced one sum)
  }
}

print(evenlist)


###### Question 4 starts here
#Determine whether a number is prime
print("Question 4")

#Note: a prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 
#that is has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

test_prime_list = c(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 100, 2000)
divisor = 1:2000
cleaned_primes = 0

count_of_primes = 0
#status_of_prime = FALSE #later I will need something to store logical values and modify it


for (integer in test_prime_list)
  {
  
  for (div in divisior) #probablly not the best approach
  {
    if (prime / 1 == prime && prime / prime == 1)
    }#(1) Need to incorporate NOT; only these factors are present and (2) See if && or & is the best approach
    #sore this successful property in cleaned_primes?
  cleaned_primes = c(cleaned_primes, integer)
}

print(cleaned_primes)



###### Question 5 starts here
#Store all prime numbers from 1 to 200 in a vector and print them
print("Question 5")

primes_upto_200 = 1:200
print(primes_upto_200)

sequence_primes = 0 

for (num in primes_upto_200)
{
  ##if (n %%2 == 0) ##this would have to change based on result from question #4
  {
    sequence_primes = c(sequence_primes, num)
}

print(sequence_primes)
