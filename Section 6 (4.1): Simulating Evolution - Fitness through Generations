#1) Set up a population of 1000 asexually reproducing, haploid individuals where
#they have the wild-type allele or the mutant allele. 
# 0 is the wild-type allele, 1 is the mutant allele.
#So your population will be 999 0s and one 1.

zeroes = numeric(999)
population = c(zeroes, 1)
print(population)


#2) The mutant has a selective advantage â€“ it is more fit. 
#So the fitness of the mutant is 1, while the fitness of the wild-type is 0.97. 
#Set up a vector that contains the fitnesses for each individual. 
#This vector should be linked to the population vector so the fitness at a position should also corresponding to the individual in the population.

storing_fitness_of_zeroes = rep(c(0.97), times = 999) #used to repeat a vector
print(storing_fitness_of_zeroes)

fitness = c(storing_fitness_of_zeroes , 1)
print(fitness)


#3) Use your population and your fitness vectors to generate the next generation. 
#Use the sample() function.

new_generation = sample(population, 1000, replace = TRUE, prob = fitness) #We set to TRUE so some may not be picked. If we allow selection with replacement, then all will be given the chance to reproduce regardless of fitness.
print(new_generation)
